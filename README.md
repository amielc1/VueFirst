### Step 1: Install Node.js and npm
Ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. Vite requires Node.js (version 12.0.0 or higher). You can check your Node.js and npm versions by running:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

### Step 2: Create a Vue Project with Vite
You can use the `create-vite` tool to quickly scaffold a new project. To create a new Vue project with Vite, open your terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-vue-app -- --template vue
```

Replace `my-vue-app` with your desired project name. This command downloads the necessary setup for a Vue project configured to use Vite.

### Step 3: Navigate to Your Project Directory
Change into your newly created project directory:

```bash
cd my-vue-app
```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies
Install the project dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

This step reads the `package.json` file in your project directory and installs all the required dependencies listed there.

### Step 5: Run the Development Server
To start the development server, use the following npm script:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command starts a local development server, builds your project using Vite, and typically opens your default web browser to display your new Vue app. The development server also provides hot module replacement (HMR) for an efficient development experience, automatically refreshing your app as you edit and save files.

### Additional Steps: Build and Serve for Production
When you're ready to build your app for production, Vite provides an optimized build command:

```bash
npm run build
```

After building, you can serve your production-ready app using a static file server. One simple option is to install `serve` and use it to serve your build output:

```bash
npm install -g serve
serve -s dist
```

This serves the `dist` directory on a local web server, which contains your production build.

Vite offers a highly optimized and fast development environment for Vue.js projects. It automatically handles many optimizations under the hood, making your development workflow much more efficient.
